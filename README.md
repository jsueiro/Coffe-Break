# Coffe-Break
Coffe Break is a small experiment that groups BeautifulSoup from Python and a basic page that uses bootstrap. 
When runt, it creates a small page that gathers the latest news from Hacker News (with more than 99 votes) to be read during my coffee break. 

Simple, no ads, no nothing. Lots to improve of course as this is a base schema, I'm planning on adding train information of my city and weather (through API requests).
